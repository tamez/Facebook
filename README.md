**Hours: 12**


**Project Requirements**

Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
Tapping the Done button animates the photo back into its position in the news feed.
On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.
